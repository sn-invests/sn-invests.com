						<h2>Who We Are</h2>
						
						<p><strong>Fabian Thylmann</strong> started his career as programmer right out of school in 1997, starting his first 
						company focusing on statistical analysis and high traffic websites. Through his own projects as well 
						as working for multiple companies, he began to notice the inefficiencies in their technical setups and thus, 
						in 2007, started buying up companies first in Europe, then in the US, drastically increasing their profitability quickly.</p>
						 
						<p>Within just 5 years, he built the biggest adult entertainment company in the world, Manwin, supported by a Wall Street Credit. 
						With offices in 5 countries, over 1200 employees and serving over 65 million unique 
						visitors a day, its reach and size surpassed everything previously known in the industry. </p>
						
						<p>Having sold all his shares end of 2013, he now focuses on investing in startups, in many different verticals. </p>
						
						<p><strong>STATSnet BVBA</strong>, under the brand SN Invests, is a small investment company helping startups get their early 
						life right and think big. With a team of 5, we like to brainstorm together with prospects about their problems and 
						opportunities, focussing on adding value as a mentor independently from a possible investment.</p>

					<h2>What We Do</h2>
					
					<p>Our aim is to support the founders in developing their business as intensely as possible.</p>
					<p>Especially for early-stage investments we place value on outstanding management that blazes new trails well off the beaten path.</p>
					<p>The financing of market leaders is a shared journey involving several stages. It is a journey in 
					which we work with established financial investors, acting as the lead or co-investor. Our typical investment is between 0.125 and 5 million euros.</p>
					<p>We identify opportunities, build companies and retain ownership over time.</p>
					<p>Our primary focus is on building proven, transaction-based business models in the online and mobile space. 
					We are however not limited by such parameters and seize other attractive opportunities whenever they arise.</p>
					<p>Established in 1999 in Brussels, Belgium, the company is now headquatered in Luxembourg.</p>
